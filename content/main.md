Whether you landed on this page intentionally or by mistake, since you are here, you might be interested to know who
I am.

My name is Felipe Torres Gonz√°lez and I am an engineer who grew up in the sunny Andalusia. Like many human beings
these days, I studied Computer Science at the [**University of Granada**](https://www.ugr.es/en) (Spain) in search of an
easy future life, full of keystrokes surrounded by the comfortable atmosphere provided by our friend the A/C machine.

However, I have to admit, that I also like it too. Since I was a kid, I have always been fascinated by electronics and
computers, so it was sort of a perfect match. I obtained my college degree in
[**Computer Science**](https://grados.ugr.es/informatica/) with a specialisation in Computer Engineering in 2015, and
a [**Master's Degree on Data Science and Computer Engineering**](https://masteres.ugr.es/datcom/) in 2017, both from
the University of Granada.

My professional career has been divided between the academia, where I have worked as a researcher and Ph.D. student;
and private companies. My versatile profile has allowed me to contribute in different areas: from writing scientific
papers, and presenting results in international symposiums; to designing digital HW for FPGAs or SW code for web services.
