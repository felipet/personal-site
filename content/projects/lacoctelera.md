*La Coctelera* is an attempt to build a collaborative data base of cocktail
recipes.

This is one of my favourite projects. I've been working on it for
months and it's getting closer to it's deployment in production.

You can check out the code for the project in this [repository](https://github.com/felipet/lacoctelera_backend).

Stay tuned for updates on this project.
