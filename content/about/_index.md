# Education

## Master's Degree on Data Science and Computer Engineering

I obtained my Master's degree on [Data Science and Computer Engineering](https://masteres.ugr.es/datcom/) with a final mark of 9.587 out of 10 from the [University of Granada](https://www.ugr.es/en) (Spain). My Master's thesis focused on the design of a SoC-FPGA architecture for high-performance synchronisation applications. In particular, that design aimed to design a White-Rabbit slave node on a system based on Zynq-7000 devices.

The thesis is available on my [Github](https://github.com/felipet/memoria_tfm) space, but is written in Spanish.

## Bachelor Degree on Computer Science

I obtained my Bachelor degree on [Computer Science](https://grados.ugr.es/informatica/informacion/presentacion) with mention on Computer Engineering (specialisation) with a final mark of 8.376 out of 10 from the [University of Granada](https://www.ugr.es/en) (Spain). I chose most of the optional lessons related to digital HW design. My Bachelor thesis focused on the optimisation of a conjugate gradient algorithm for the simulation of spill evolution over a mass of water. Mainly, I beat Intel's Fortran compiler thanks to deep analysis of the organisation of the data (sparse matrices) and the manual usage of AVX instructions via inline assembly code. I also explored the possibility of increasing the performance using GPUs with CUDA.
