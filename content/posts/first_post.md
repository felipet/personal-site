Here it is! After many years of thinking about starting to write a personal blog, the time has come, and the proof is in this blog post.

> Why now? Why didn't you start it before?

I was reluctant to start a new blog because I felt that the internet was already overcrowded with content and that my modest writing wouldn't add anything of value to the vast world wide web. However, about a year ago I started to spend more time working on some personal projects that I think are worth sharing. Moreover, they might need some more details than those provided by the developer's docs and other (more formal) sources of information.

So the main purpose of this blog is this: to share updates and further information about my personal side projects. I expect to add more stuff about my hobbies in the future, specially about investment and finance (does it qualify as a hobby?), but I can't promise that because it all depends on how much free time I have.

Meanwhile, if you don't know who am I, go and have a look at my about page:
